# Web3-journey

This repo documents my journey into Web3, Solidity, and blockchain development. I'm currently focused on learning how to build and contribute to decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols.

## 🚀 Skills I'm Building
- Smart contracts (Solidity)
- NFT minting (ERC-721 & ERC-1155)
- Web3 tools like Remix, MetaMask, Hardhat
- Crypto wallet integration
- Community support & moderation in Web3 projects

## 📁 Learning Projects
- [x] NFT minting contract (testnet)
- [ ] Simple staking contract
- [ ] DAO voting prototype

 🧠 Currently Learning
- Solidity basics and smart contract structure
- Token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)
- Security best practices

More updates soon as I continue learning and contributing!
